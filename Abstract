In today's healthcare environment, AI-based healthcare chatbots have become an
essential option, providing a conversational interface for medical information,
symptom analysis, appointment scheduling, and health coaching. This study
carefully examines the evolution, design, and significant influence of artificial
intelligence and natural language processing on user experience and accessibility in
healthcare. We examine how they fill in healthcare service gaps, maintain round-
the-clock availability, and encourage user-friendly interactions. Additionally, the
ethics of user data security and privacy are looked at.
